This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning model for predicting the developability and manufacturability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). By combining theoretical calculations, experimental data, and advanced ML techniques, this tool aims to streamline the mAb development process and accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics.

Key features:

* Theoretical Property Calculation:  Calculates molecular weight, pI, aromaticity, instability index, and GRAVY from mAb sequence data.
* Experimental Data Integration: Incorporates biophysical characterization data (SDS-PAGE, SEC, MALDI-TOF, DLS, Tm, aggregation) for comprehensive analysis.
* Machine Learning Prediction:  Employs state-of-the-art deep learning models to predict mAb quality based on integrated data.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for easy prediction and analysis.
